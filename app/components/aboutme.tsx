            <p className="about-me-p"> I am a self-taught developer with a passion for creating beautiful, interactive websites.
              I started my journey with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through the odin Project.
              I have 2 certifications in web development from freeCodeCamp ; Repsonsive Web Design and Datastructures and Algorithms.
              I also completed the Bob Ziroll React course on Scrimba, as an introduction into React.
              I am currently learning React and Next.js to further my skills and knowledge in frontend development.
              Why do I want to be in web development? I love the different stages of web development, from the expression of creatitivity while designing the website, to the logic and problem solving while coding the website.
              I have a knack for problem solving and I am always eager to learn new things.
              I am looking for an opportunity to grow and learn in a professional environment.
